"Welcome back, have you done your Dicoding Submission 2?"

Fengha's voice was cold and the tone speak of no nonsense. She stood beside the round control, glancing away from the clipboard in her hand as she turned towards me. Her dark grey eyes gazed upon me as she flicked her dark grey hair.

I shrunk a little under her unrelenting gaze.

"Ahh, about that," I cleared my throat and began circling her. "There was something urgent that I wish to do…"

The woman narrowed her eyes and turned to her clipboard. "I don't remember writing down anything important for today…" she turned back towards me. "Then again, you did say it's merely urgent, not important. Then, what is it?"

"You know, it has been far too long since I meet my old acquaintance from the lower reality and I simply wish to…"

"No, get back to work," Fengha said. "You actually have something you have to do tomorrow,"

The woman turned back to the console without another words.

"This will not take long, please… For old time sake?"

There was a moment of silence before the woman finally turned towards me. "You are far more troublesome than your predecessor, you know that?" she said while pulling the lever on the console. The room around me began to vibrate and the sound of hope echoes through the chamber.

"My sincerest apology for that, overseer," I bowed a little. "So, can you take me too…" I paused for a moment. "Let us begin with visiting the City of Nexus,"

"Set course to Dimension 46," Fengha said and the floor began shaking. I took hold of the railings near me and held on to it. "While we wait, is there any other underlying reason why you wishes to do this?"

"Hmm? Ahh, an acquaintance of mine is having a birthday tomorrow so I wish to see if I can ask some of my friends to make a birthday wish for him,"

"I see…" Fengha looked up for a moment. "To think that you'd use your [Reality Shift] skill for something so pointless,"

"It is not pointless dear overseer, this is merely an act out of kindness and care," I looked up at the ceiling, crystal pillar that connects to the round control panel spun gently in the dim light. "I admit I do not know of this person that much… but I wish that this may change that…"

"I see…" Fengha looked back at her notepad and began writing in it. "What's his name?"

I grinned a little. "Ravie Azmie,"

"Age?"

I blinked a little. "I'm not sure…"

Fengha rolled her eyes. "You sure you know this person?"

"Shh, just make one,"

The woman began writing on her clipboard. Her expression is still as stone cold as ever as her hand move fast across the paper. Soon, she was finished and she handed me the paper.

"Here you go,"

Happy Birthday, Ravie Azmie

Today marks another year of your life.

If you are around 20 to 30, that means you are three quarters away to the limit of average human lifespan.

Please do not waste it. Cherish your life, it is the only one you have. Don't give it to someone else. No one, is worth more than you are. No one, gets to tell you where to go other than yourself. Spend more time listening to your mind and heart than thinking what others think of you.

What came from within is far more important than what came from outside.

Best Regards, Fengha

I grinned a little as I wrote the message. "Reminding him of his own mortality? Really?"

"I've seen far too many people wasted their life trying to reach an unreachable goal of 'trying to meet someone else's expectation',"

The door behind me opened, revealing an outdoor café. "Ah, we're here," I waved my hand. "I'll see you later Fengha!

"Later, Pandu,"

I stepped out of my copy of the TARDIS and towards the outdoor café. I wonder if… Ah, nevermind, there she is!

A little girl with short white hair and sparkling yellow eyes sat on a round table on the outdoor part of the café. Facing her is young woman with dark brown hair and green eyes. The two of them are looking at me with the latter waving her hand kindly.

"And as fate wills it, I meet you both here," I stepped towards them and sat down on one of the empty seat. A tower of dessert and cake stood on the round table. "How are you Seven? Alyce?"

"We're just going out for some coffee," Alyce said with a smile. She then turned to the white haired little girl. "Haios chan, say something,"

The little girl put down her cup of latte and dropped her head on the table. "I got reincarnated as a fucking Chuuni…" she slowly turned towards me, staring at me in disbelief. "How the hell!?"

I blinked a little. "You have something against Chuuni?"

"How are you not cringing!? Good god!" Haios shook her head. "Just… what is wrong with you!? I thought the existence of the Sequence is supposed to be a secret but you just… Straight up mention it every chance you got!"

I chuckled a little. "Tis the reason why I am a Chuuni, Lady Paradox," I cleared my throat. "No matter what I do, no matter what I say, no one is going to believe me. It is the truth woven into a lie…"

Haios sighed a little grabbed a brownie. "Good luck with that,"

I nodded a little then turned to Alyce. "Ahh, Alyce, a friend of mine is having a birthday tomorrow, would be so kind as to write something for him?"

Alyce nodded a little. "I'd love to, what's his name?" she took out a pink notebook and pen. "How old is he?"

"His name is Ravie Azmie, I'm afraid I do not know how old he is… yet,"

"Ahaha, it's alright, hope you can be better friends with him after this," she began writing on the notebook. A smile on her face and sparkle in her eyes. Though her true name is redacted and my love for her is expunged, she is still the same woman who has captured my heart.

"And done! Here you go!"

Dear Ravie,

Happy Birthday! You are now older than you were a year ago, ahaha!

That was not as funny as I thought it would be… Ahem,

Not only are you older, but you are wiser and smarter. You've learned a lot this entire year, haven't you? Whether it's a skill, a trivia, a piece of wisdom, or simply a new story you've read. All of those things are now a part of you.

Every knowledge, every skill, every thoughts, every opinion, every story, and everything you've witnessed over this year… Has now become a part of you!

If this is a game, you are one step closer at getting your 100% Achievement, congratulations!

My only advice is that: It is better to regret something than to regret not doing something.

For every dream you let go, is another part that you've lost

Wish you the happiest birthday, Alyce

"Ahh, this is nice, I'll be sure to give this to him."

"Okay, thanks!" Alyce then turned to Haios. "Well? Haios?"

The loli handed me a piece of paper. "Here,"

Dear Ravie,

Today is your birthday, woo! You're still alive, congrats I guess.

Yes, existence is pain. Yes, society is shit. Yes, people will never accept you for who you are. Yes, I'm an edgelord loli, deal with it.

But you know what? Just cuz everyone is shit, the world is shit, and existence is pain, doesn't mean you should be shit too. If you have to be the only piece of gem in an ocean of turd, then so be it

Just cuz everyone is shit, you should never give up on being not shit.

In other words, always try to be nice and never fail to be kind. Even if it sucks to be the only one who does.

Best of luck, Iteration 7

I raised an eyebrow and turned back to my ancestor. The girl is sipping on the latte, refusing to meet my gaze.

"It has never crossed my mind that you…"

"Shut," Haios raised her hand. "I don't wanna hear it,"

I chuckled a little and looked at Alyce. "Thanks for the letter, you too Seven, I'll see you around,"

"Bye bye!" Alyce said with a wave.

With that, I stood up and walked away from the café. The polished marble floor gave way to the dirt road as I step into the streets of Nexus. It's a nice little town, set in a world where magic exists it's a place of beauty and nature.

"Yo, Lord Paradox! Isn't it?"

I turned around and saw a couple walking towards me. A blond haired man and a dark haired girl. The former wore a simple steel plate and the latter wore a cloak. of sort. "Ah, it is the Dragon Rider of Nexus, Alto and the Wandering Witch, Linda," I said with a grin. "How are you? Has life been treating you well?"

Alto chuckled a little. "I'm literally just a city guard, but yes, everything is well, right?" he turned to Linda

The witch rolled her eyes. "Could be better, honestly," Linda added. "What brings you here, Lord Paradox?"

"Ahh, I simply wishes to have a trip down the memory lane… It has been far too long since the last time I was here," I tilted my head. "Say, can the both of you do me a favor? I am collecting some Birthday Letters for a friend of mine."

"Birthday letters?" Linda asked.

"For an acquaintance of mine," I chuckled a little. "A bit silly now that I think about it, but I would appreciate it if you would write something for him. A piece of advice, a joke, or anything in that regards."

"Sure," Alto said. "You have any pen or…" I handed him a clipboard. "Ah, thanks,"

I turned to Linda who already took out her book and pencil. "So, what's their name?" Linda asked.

"It's Ravie Azmie," I told them. "I am afraid that I am not certain how old he is,"

"Human?"

I smirked a little. "Beastfolk,"

The two began writing. Alto is quick in the way he writes, not wasting time with the words. He handed me before Linda could even finish half of it. "Here, a bit quick, but uhh… You get the idea," he said with a grin.

I raised an eyebrow and read the letter.

To Ravie

It's your big day my man, take a load off, kick back, relax, and grab a cold one with your pals . You earned it, for all the hell this year has given you, you deserve a break.

Wish you the best, Alto

I grinned a little as I read the content of the message. "Thanks Alto," I turned to Linda who just finished the letter.

"Here is mine," Linda said. "Tell Ravie I say hi and Happy Birthday!"

Dear Ravie Azmie

The trees sang with the wind as mother nature gave birth to the first human. They sang the same tune as their descendants were sang their own song. They sing the same tune despite us playing our own music…

Take a moment to listen… The song that were sang in this exact moment… When the world celebrated the gift that were sent here by mother earth…

Today, we the world sings to celebrate the gift of Ravie Azmie, into the world…

With Kindest Regards, Linda Vistaria

"How adorable," I commented with a grin. "Thank you very much Linda, you too Alto," I pocketed all the messages I've been collecting. "By the way, have you seen Yura anywhere?"

"Yura? I thought you, I mean, Lady Paradox sent her on a mission?" Alto asked.

"Really now?" I turned to Linda who just shrugged a little. "Well, I think I know where Seven sent her," I turned around. "See ya later,"

"Later,"

"Good bye Lord Paradox,"

[[[LINE BREAK]]]

I teleported right in the midde of a large meadow. In the distance away from me is a large house. At the yard in front of it is a guy leaning near a large tree, gazing at the clouds.

"Good Afternoon Karma! Please excuse my sudden intrusion into your household,"

"Lord Paradox?" The guy walked towards me, a soft smile on his face. "It's alright Lord Paradox, do you have a mission?"

"Ah, I simply wishes to visit after a long time of not visiting," I cleared my throat. "Also, I am collecting a birthday letter for a friend of mine,"

"Birthday card?"

"You hear me, it's nearing my friend's birthday and I wish to collect a bunch of birthday cards for him,"

Karma chuckled a little. "I would love to," he tapped his foot on the ground. There was a slight rumble and a tree grows out of the ground. The small tree has white leaves, almost like paper, only a bit thicker.

The guy plucked a single leaf and snapped the twig. Then he began using the twig as a pen to write a message. "What's his name again?"

"Ravie Azmie,"

He nodded and started writing in on the leaf with the twig. The end product, of course, is identical to regular paper and pen.

"Here you go, Lord Paradox, tell him I said hi,"

Dear Ravie,

From one stranger to another, I wish you the happiest birthday.

Why would I, a complete stranger wishes you happy birthday? Is it because Lord Paradox asks me too? Is it because I'm a nice person? Is it because I wanted something out of this?

Nah, I just think that saying Happy Birthday will make you feel better. By being kind, I'm doing my part to make the world a nicer place to live.

Hope you feel the same way and pass the kindness everyone,

With kind regards, Karma

"Humu, this is simply outstanding, thank you Karma,"

Karma just chuckled in response. "You're exaggerating, when is his birthday anyway? Tomorrow?"

"Yeah, it's…" a blonde haired woman stepped out of the house. She turned to look at me and Karma before hurrying towards us. "Ah, good afternoon Adila, I apologize for the sudden intruision,"

"Lord Paradox," she bowed at me a little. "How may I be of service?"

"Ahh, you see, it is nearing a friend of mine's birthday and I am looking for people to write something,"

"Write something?"

"Yeah, I mean, birthday…"

The woman nodded a little. "Karma, may I borrow your pen and paper?"

Karma plucked another large leaf out of the small tree he's grown. Then handed her both that and the twig. "Here,"

"What is the recipient's name?"

"Ravie Azmie,"

Adila then began writing. I'm not really sure what she will be writing for she isn't necessarily someone who'd understand the concept of birthday. However… Yeah, this'll be interesting…

Good Day Ravie Azmie

Happy Birthday

Stay true to your heart, never let the past hold you down, and never give in to hatred.

With High Regards, Adila Justicar

"Humu humu… Quite short and straight to the point,"

"Too much words will blur out the meaning, Lord Paradox," Adila said. "I simply wishes him the best of birthday and advise him to listen to their heart."

"Power of Love?"

"Love, Justice, and Faith,"

"I suppose that is correct, humu humu," I turned to Karma who nodded in agreement. "Well then, I will have to leave, I shall bid thee farewell!"

"Farewell,"

[[[LINE BREAK]]]

"Ahh, there you are Yura!"

A lone black haired girl is sitting at the edge of a cliff, gazing at the void beyond her. She turned towards me and her dark red eyes widened in surprise.

"L-Lord Paradox! A-ano…" she stood up, almost slipping into the void. "Uh, uhmm… I'm simply, uhh…"

"It is quite alright, I have no intention of berating you of anything, Yura," I walked closer to her. "So… How are you?"

"I-I'm fine! Everything is fine, don't worry…" she glanced at the void behind her.

"Visiting your friend again?"

Yura averted her gaze. "Maybe…"

"So, while you wait for the gate to open…" I sat down next to her. "Would you help me with something?"

"Yes, I will do anything," she said with a confident look on her face.

"Can you write a letter for me?"

The girl blinked a little and all confidence left her expression. "Uh… umm… a letter?"

"A birthday letter, my friend Ravie Azmie is celebrating his birthday soon so… I am collecting some letters for him,"

"Oh… OH! Oh?" the girl tited her head. "So… you're asking us?"

"Humu humu, If it isn't too much trouble,"

Yura looked away for a moment… "Umm… sure, Lord Paradox, I'll try to write something,"

"Make it good, okay? Tell him to have the happiest birthday and give him some advice."

Yura nodded as I handed her a clipboard. "Okay, happy birthday…"

Happy Birthday Ravie Azmie

I am Yura, The Mistress of Spacetime! Today I am wishing you Happy Birthday!

So… Happy Birthday!

…

My advice is to never give up on your goals!

"..."

"C-can I try that again?"

"No, this is good…" I turned to Yura who looked like she's about to cry. "Now, now, Yura don't you worry, I am sure he'll appreciate this. No, wait, do not cry, I forbid you to cry in my pre-" the girl vanished in a flash of purple light.

I sighed a little. "Seven… How do you deal with her?"

I was about to return to Nexus when a certain blue box appeared behind me. The door opened, revealing Fengha the Overseer. "It's past midnight,"

I cringed a little at the look she's giving me. "Wait, wait, wait, I haven't made something yet, uhh…" I looked up in deep thought. "A poem!"

In the time far beyond,

they're watching you today

The joyful and the fond,

the sorrowful and decay

And the skies and the moon,

the mountains and dunes

They sang along the tune,

together in this room!

Far in the clouds,

we lock our dreams away

But some day it will rain,

the pieces of our days

You walk down the halls,

the halls of Could Have Been

the halls that Never Has

and the unfinished walls

Deep in the halls

Depiction of Success

A picture of Regret

and the empty Picture Frames

Far in the halls,

they spoke to you as one

All the things you love,

and all the things you hate

Take a heed my dear friend,

a message from the end

Your journey's just begun,

so let's make it to the end

To love what you care

To care of what you love

Forgive of what you hate

Let love guide you to the end

Time far beyond,

they spoke to you as one

Care of what you love,

forgive of what you hate
